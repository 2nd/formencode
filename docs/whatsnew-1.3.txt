What's New In FormEncode 1.3
==============================

This article explains the latest changes in `FormEncode` version 1.3
compared to its predecessor, `FormEncode` 1.2.5.

Feature Additions
-----------------

 - Support validation of email addresses with unicode domain names.

Backwards Incompatibilities
---------------------------

 - `FormEncode` 1.3 is no longer compatible with Python 2.3, 2.4, or 2.5.
 
   The reason? We could not easily "straddle" Python 2 and 3 versions and support Python 2 versions older than Python 2.6. You will need Python 2.6 or better to run this version of FormEncode. If you need to use Python 2.5, you should use the most recent 1.2.X release of FormEncode. 

 - Validation of email addresses using `resolve_domain` option now requires the dnspython third party library instead of pyDNS. pyDNS also does not support Python 3.

Documentation Enhancements
